My research agenda focuses on conserving the processes that maintain biodiversity and ecosystem services, with the overarching goal of balancing a thriving natural world with the food and land use needs of a growing human population. I conduct research at the intersection of applied entomology, community ecology, and agricultural sustainability, focusing on pollinators because of their central role in both natural and managed landscapes. 

My aim is to discover new insights into how plant and insect communities persist through time and across space, enabling the prediction and conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. I combine theory, modeling, field experiments and observation to conduct research that is actionable, inclusive, reproducible, and open.
